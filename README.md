# Word-Guess-Game

Test your psychic abilities! The User has (lucky number) 9 tries to correctly guess the letter that the Computer is "thinking."

# How It Works

At the start of each round, the Computer randomly chooses a letter. The User tries to guess the Computer's letter by pressing any key from 'a' to 'z'. The letters selected by the User shows up in 'Letters Guessed' section. When the User correctly guesses the letter, the wins go up by 1. When the User runs out of guesses, the User losses go up by 1. The game restarts once the User wins or runs out of guesses.
